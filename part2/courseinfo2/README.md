# CourseInfo Part 2 [FullStack Open]

This **courseinfo app** was created to meet the requirements of [2.1-2.5](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/rendering_a_collection_modules#exercises-2-1-2-5) of [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

This is a very basic React.js app to display data. Any number of courses can be displayed (drawn from mock data).
