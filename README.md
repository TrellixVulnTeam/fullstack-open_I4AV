# FullStack Open

This repo houses my coursework for the 2021 [FullStack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/).

The course is an introduction to modern JavaScript-based full-stack web development. Technologies include React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js

# Create React App

Exercises in this repo were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
